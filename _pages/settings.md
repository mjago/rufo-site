- [align_chained_calls](#align_chained_calls)
- [double_newline_inside_type](#double_newline_inside_type)
- [parens_in_def](#parens_in_def)

### Usage

Use the following settings in a `.rufo` file. Each configuration is a call with one argument. For example:

```ruby
# .rufo
trailing_commas :never
parens_in_def :dynamic
```

### align_case_when

Align successive case when?

- `false`: (default) don't align case when (preserve existing code)
- `true`: align successive case when

Given this code:

```ruby
case exp
when foo then 2
when barbaz then 3
end
```

With `true`, the formatter will change it to:

```ruby
case exp
when foo    then 2
when barbaz then 3
end
```

With `false` it won't modify it.

### align_chained_calls

Align chained calls to the dot?

- `false`: (default) don't align chained calls to the dot (preserve existing code)
- `true`: align chained calls to the dot

Given this code:

```ruby
foo.bar
   .baz

foo.bar
  .baz
```

With `true`, the formatter will change it to:

```ruby
foo.bar
   .baz

foo.bar
   .baz
```

With `false` it won't modify it.

Note that with `false` it will keep it aligned to the dot if it's already like that.

### double_newline_inside_type

Allow an empty line inside a type declaration?

- `:dynamic`: (default) allow at most one empty newline
- `:no`: no empty newlines inside type declarations

Given this code:

```ruby
class Foo

  CONST = 1

end

class Bar
  CONST = 2
 end
```

With `:no` the formatter will change it to:

```ruby
class Foo
  CONST = 1
end

class Bar
  CONST = 2
end
```

With `:dynamic` it won't modify it.

### parens_in_def

Use parentheses in defs?

- `:yes`: (default) always use parentheses (add them if they are not there)
- `:dynamic`: don't modify existing methods parentheses choice

Given this code:

```ruby
def foo x, y
end

def bar(x, y)
end
```

With `:yes` the formatter will change it to:

```ruby
def foo(x, y)
end

def bar(x, y)
end
```

With `:dynamic` it won't modify it.

### spaces_around_binary

How to format spaces around a binary operator?

- `:dynamic`: (default) allow any number of spaces around a binary operator
- `:one`: at most one space around a binary operator

Given this code:

```ruby
1+2
1 +2
1+ 2
1  +  2
```

With `:one` the formatter will change it to:

```ruby
1+2
1 + 2
1+2
1 + 2
```

Note that with `:one` the spaces are kept balanced: if there's no space
before the operator, no space is kept after it. If there's a space
before the operator, a space is added after it.

With `:dynamic` it won't modify it.

### trailing_commas

Use trailing commas in array and hash literals, and keyword arguments?

- `:always`: (default) always put a trailing comma
- `:never`: never put a trailing comma

Given this code:

```ruby
[
  1,
  2
]

[
  1,
  2,
]

{
  foo: 1,
  bar: 2
}

{
  foo: 1,
  bar: 2,
}

foo(
  x: 1,
  y: 2
)

foo(
  x: 1,
  y: 2,
)
```

With `:always`, the formatter will change it to:

```ruby
[
  1,
  2,
]

[
  1,
  2,
]

{
  foo: 1,
  bar: 2,
}

{
  foo: 1,
  bar: 2,
}

foo(
  x: 1,
  y: 2,
)

foo(
  x: 1,
  y: 2,
)
```
With `:never`, the formatter will change it to:

```ruby
[
  1,
  2
]

[
  1,
  2
]

{
  foo: 1,
  bar: 2
}

{
  foo: 1,
  bar: 2
}

foo(
  x: 1,
  y: 2
)

foo(
  x: 1,
  y: 2
)
```
